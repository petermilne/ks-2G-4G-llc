RTM-T HOSTDRV

Host side driver for RTM-T and ACQ-FIBER-HBA

Any questions?: please contact me any time:

Please review main instructions at:
./html/index.html


RTM-T:
rtm-t.ko : 

auto loaded by depmod.
Creates the RTM-T mailbox regs, DMA device, HOST buffers and SLIP UART

Before running any of the example apps eg rtm-t-stream-disk, review the
site-specific setups in testscripts/rc.local.
This file controls device permissions and mounts disk drives as required;
this will almost certainly need to be customized for your local environment.


ACQ-FIBER-HBA
rtm-t.ko : 

auto loaded by depmod.
Creates the RTM-T mailbox regs, DMA device, HOST buffers and SLIP UART

There's also i2c condition monitoring for SFP modules:

Valid for SFP modules Avago: AFBR-57R5APZ


./testscripts/avago_monitor [BUS]

FLASHING RTM-T:
Flash upgrade controlled by the acq using /usr/local/care/rtm-t_flash

FLASHING ACQ-FIBER-HBA:
It's probably best to set up a custom driver with SPI support for this purpose.
The SPI interface brings in a lot of modules that probably aren't helpful
dependencies in normal use.


make ACQ_FHBA_SPI=1

NB: mtd/* spi/* are copies of CENTOS5.5 code, patched.
NB: build mtd-utils

IDEALLY, these modules will be pre-built for your kernel in the normal way.
Otherwise, some hacking is to be expected.

STUB normal rtm-t.ko autoload and proceed as follows:

./test-scripts/load.flash_device

copy flash image acqfiber_hba_top.bit to current directory

./test-scripts/acq-fiber-hba_flash
